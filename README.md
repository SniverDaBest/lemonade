# Lemonade
[![Builds](https://github.com/SniverDaBest/lemonade/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/SniverDaBest/lemonade/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

# Info
Lemonade is an OS built in rust, based off of blog_os, created by [Phil-Opp](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os). The blog he created helps people who love Rust, learn how to run it on bare metal, and make an OS. You can find it at <https://os.phil-opp.com/>. I would recommend it to people who want to get better at using Rust, and learning a `no_std` environment.\
\
Lemonade itself should NOT be used in production, and it probably never should. It's not even working much yet. It builds, but there are some bugs, and a lot of absolute garbage code that I wrote. *(note: I'm not a good programmer...)*

# Contributions
I would be very grateful if people would contribute. However, I know that probably won't happen much, or even at all... Also, I will try and look through issues/PRs on GitHub, that get opened.
