# Info
Lemonade is an OS built in rust, based off of blog_os, created by [Phil-Opp](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os). The blog he created helps people who love Rust, learn how to run it on bare metal, and make an OS. You can find it at <https://os.phil-opp.com/>. I would recommend it to people who want to get better at using Rust, and learning a `no_std` environment.\
\
Lemonade itself should NOT be used in production, and it probably never should. It's not even working much yet. It builds *(probably)*, but there are some bugs, and a lot of absolute garbage code that I wrote. *(note: I'm not a good programmer...)*

# Contributions
I would be very grateful if people would contribute. However, I know that probably won't happen much, or even at all... Also, I will try and look through issues/PRs on GitHub, that get opened.

Here are some notes for the users, about bugs, and other things that may happen.
1. You may get flooded with dots when running. That happens to me, and I don't know how to fix it.
2. When typing, it may repeat what you've typed. That's normal. *(well... it's normal in the, "yes this is supposed to happen" area. it is still a bug)*
3. True randomness is broken for some reason.
